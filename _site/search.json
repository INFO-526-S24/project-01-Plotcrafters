We’ll split the data based on twilight phases, count sightings for each phase, and then see if there’s a pattern using statistical tests.\n\nThe Places/Details from places.csv:\n\nAnalysis Goal: To investigate if there’s a connection between UFO sightings and place and population density.\nHypothesis: UFO sightings are more frequent in densely populated areas due to increased human activity and reporting or does this depend on the place (lat/long).\nMethod:\n-&gt; Merge the UFO sightings dataset with city population data and places details. -&gt; Use statistical methods like correlation analysis or regression to explore the relationship between population density and UFO sighting frequency.\nIn simpler terms, we’re checking if more UFO sightings happen in places with more people. We’ll compare UFO reports with population data from different cities and it details to see if there’s a link. Then, we’ll use graphs to understand if the number of sightings goes up or down as population density changes and use filters of place details."
