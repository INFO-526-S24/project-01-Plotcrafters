    "text": "Question 1 : How many UFO sightings have been reported worldwide, and are there particular regions where these sightings occur more frequently?\n\nIntroduction\nFor this question we want to know where the frequency and location, or the concentration, of UFO sightings. Under the ufo_sightings dataset we require the longitude and latitude of the sighting as well as the count. We’re interested in this question because it’s in our best interest to know where delusional people who claim ufo sightings are so we can avoid them.\n\n\nApproach\nWe first ensure that the dataset is clean, with no missing or invalid values that could affect our analysis. We then calculate summary statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of the number of sightings globally to give us an idea of the distribution of ufo sightings.\nWe then create a geographical visualization where we use latitude, longitude, and state data to create a heatmap and choropleth map to visualize the global distribution of UFO sightings. This will help identify geographical hotspots and trends. For our last visualization we do a spatial analysis via spatial clustering using algorithms like K-means to identify regions with a high concentration of sightings. Additionally, we’ll assess spatial autocorrelation to determine if there are spatial patterns in the distribution of sightings.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nsuppressMessages({\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n})\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n#&gt; Loading the Dataset \n\n#&gt; UFO_Sightings\n\n\nufo_sightings &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nsuppressWarnings({\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load world map data\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Read the UFO sightings data\nufo_sightings &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# Data Cleaning\nufo_sightings_clean &lt;- ufo_sightings %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(state))\n\n# Create Heatmap with map outline\nheatmap_with_map &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), color = \"black\", fill = NA) +  # Map outline\n  geom_bin2d(data = ufo_sightings_clean, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), bins = 50, color = \"black\") +  # Heatmap\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"Frequency\", low = \"#045275\", high = \"#D32F2F\") +  # Color gradient\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of UFO Sightings\", \n       subtitle = \"Heatmap Showing Frequency of Sightings\",\n       x = \"Longitude\", y = \"Latitude\") +  # Axis labels\n  theme_minimal() +  # Minimal theme\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),  # Title font size and style\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray\"),  # Subtitle font size and color\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),  # Axis text size\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),  # Legend title size\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))  # Legend text size\n\n# Print the heatmap with map outline\nprint(heatmap_with_map)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis heatmap of UFO sightings worldwide, where each bin represents a certain area on the map, and the color intensity represents the frequency of sightings in that area. This visualization will help us identify regions with higher concentrations of UFO sightings. In the above Heatmap, we can tell most of the sightings are around the USA region and little over East Europe, the frequency is not distributed around as expected, the entire map is below 2000 sightings and UAS having higher than 2000. This suggests that while UFO sightings are reported worldwide, they remain rare events. Factors such as population density, cultural beliefs, and reporting biases likely contribute to the observed distribution patterns. Further exploration of these factors is necessary to better understand the underlying reasons for the observed variations in UFO sighting frequencies.\n\nsuppressWarnings({\n# Count sightings by country\nsightings_by_country &lt;- ufo_sightings_clean %&gt;%\n  count(country)\n\n# Read world map data from ggplot2\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Merge with sightings data\nworld_map_with_sightings &lt;- left_join(world_map, sightings_by_country, by = c(\"region\" = \"country\"))\n\n# Create Choropleth Map with individual sightings as points\nchoropleth_map &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = world_map_with_sightings, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = n), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = ufo_sightings_clean, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = \"red\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Global Distribution of UFO Sightings by Country\",\n       subtitle = \"Choropleth Map with Individual Sightings\",\n       x = \"Longitude\",\n       y = \"Latitude\",\n       fill = \"Number of Sightings\") +  # Add legend title\n  theme_minimal() +  # Use minimal theme\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),  # Adjust title font size and style\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray\"),  # Adjust subtitle font size and color\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),  # Adjust x-axis title size\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),  # Adjust y-axis title size\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),  # Adjust legend title size\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10)) +  # Adjust legend text size\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"Number of Sightings\", low = \"#FFEDA0\", high = \"#F44336\")  # Adjust color gradient\n\n# Print the choropleth map\nprint(choropleth_map)\n\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph overlays the individual UFO sightings as red points on top of the choropleth map, allowing you to see both the country-level distribution and the specific locations of sightings. This along side the heatmap will give a better understanding where the freaquency and distribution of UFO sightings take place.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe heat map and choropleth map above show that most UFO sightings occur in the USA, especially in the West Bay area. While most sightings are in the West Bay, some are also seen in the northern and eastern USA.\nWe speculate that there are several reasons for such distribution of sightings. First, higher population densities in the USA contribute to more reported UFO sightings, as there are more observers to witness and report such phenomena. Second, the USA’s rich history of UFO-related media, including movies and TV shows, may influence public perception and reporting behavior, leading to increased awareness and reporting of UFO sightings. Third, the presence of military installations in certain regions, coupled with the testing of experimental aircraft or other technology, may result in misidentifications and increased UFO sightings."

    "text": "Question 2: Is there any specific time of the day when UFO sighting are more prevalent?\n\nIntroduction\nFor this question we want to visualize any temporal trends in UFO sightings throughout the day. We utilize the hour_of_day and sighting count variable from the ufo_sightings_with_time_of_day dataset. We’re interested in this question because we want to see what time of day people are most delusional.\n\n\nApproach\nWe loaded the dataset ufo_sightings from the “TidyTuesday” source using the read.csv function in R. We verified the date_time column to ensure if it is the correct data type. After that we created a new variable under the name time_of_day, and upon extracting time from date_time variable we created the following time bins: morning_hours (6:00 AM - 11:59 AM), afternoon_hours(12:00 PM - 17:59 PM), evening_hours(18:00 PM - 21:59 PM), and night_hours(22:00 PM - 5:59 AM). We analyzed sighting patterns within each bin.\nLastly, we grouped the data for each bin and counted the number of ufo sightings and saved it in dataset under the name ufo_sightings_with_time_of_day.csv. We then plotted the ufo_sightings_with_time_of_day.csv dataset using horizontal bar chart with different time bins at x-axis and count of ufo_sightings at y-axis.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nsuppressWarnings({\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(png)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nsuppressMessages({  \nlibrary(viridis)\n})\nlibrary(png)\nsuppressMessages({  \nlibrary(cowplot)\n})\n# Read the data\nufo_sightings &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# Convert character strings of date_time variable into POSIXct format\nufo_sightings$date_time &lt;- as.POSIXct(ufo_sightings$date_time, format = \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M\")\n\n# Extract the hour component\nufo_sightings$hour_of_day &lt;- hour(ufo_sightings$date_time)\n\n# Create a summary table for counts of sightings per hour\nhourly_counts &lt;- table(ufo_sightings$hour_of_day)\n\n# Convert the summary table to a data frame\nhourly_counts_df &lt;- data.frame(hour = as.numeric(names(hourly_counts)), count = as.numeric(hourly_counts))\n\n# Plotting with polar coordinates\nbar_plot_polar &lt;- ggplot(hourly_counts_df, aes(x = factor(hour), y = count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Hour of Day\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = NULL) +\n  labs(title = \"UFO Sightings by Hour of Day\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(), \n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\n  coord_polar(start = -pi/1.45)\n\n# Read the image\nimg &lt;- readPNG(\"images/q2Clock.png\")\nger &lt;- grid::rasterGrob(img, interpolate=TRUE)\n\n# Draw the plot\ncoord_plot &lt;- ggdraw(bar_plot_polar)\n\n# Combine the plot and the image\ncoord_plot + draw_grob(ger, 0.168, 0.18, 0.65, 0.65) + \n  draw_plot(bar_plot_polar)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Visibility: Darker evening skies provide better visibility, aiding in the detection of unusual objects or lights.\nLeisure Activities: Evening leisure pursuits, like stargazing and outdoor activities, increase opportunities for people to spot UFOs while relaxing outdoors.\n\n3.Cultural Influence: Cultural depictions of UFO sightings during nighttime and psychological factors may heighten vigilance and reporting of sightings during evening hours.\n\nsuppressWarnings({\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#&gt;

We speculate that this is so because when it is dark out people are less able to distincly recognize what object in the sky they are looking at. Why there are fewer sightings in the morning than in the afternoon makes little sense as there would be enough light in the sky to identify, or not identify, the object."
